Removing a remote repository
Use the git remote rm command to remove a remote URL from your repository.

The git remote rm command takes one argument:

A remote name, for example, destination
Removing the remote URL from your repository only unlinks the local and remote repositories. It does not delete the remote repository.

Example of removing a remote repository
These examples assume you're cloning using HTTPS, which is recommended.

$ git remote -v
# View current remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
Note: git remote rm does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply removes the remote and its references from your local repository.
